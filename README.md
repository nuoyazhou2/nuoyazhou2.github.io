# ABOUT ME
My name is Mingyang Cai, and I define myself as a passionate BIOINFORMATICIAN and BIOSTATISTICIAN. I got my PhD in Biostatistics while worked as a research assistant in a bioinformatics lab for 5 years. I think the two subjects really complement each other, and I enjoy enhancing my knowledge obtained through applying it to solve practical problems.
